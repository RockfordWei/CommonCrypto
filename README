CommonCrypto for GNUstep

CommonCrypto is Apple's basic cryptography library. It's not per-se relevant
for Objective-C code, but it is extensively used in Mac OS X and iOS
applications. I speculate that having it around will make porting from Mac OS X
to GNUstep easier for some people.

This version of CommonCrypto is derived from the Apple version 36064.
It contains several modifications to make it compile and run under GNUstep.
This mostly involved setting up a GNUmakefile and moving the Mach-O specific
portions of the assembly code over to ELF directives. Presently, it requires
clang and GNUstep-Make and has the following limitations:

* For now, I have hardcoded some platform specific include paths, such as
  limits.h. You might need to modify them by hand.
* Always uses the assembly versions of the crypto primitives for AES and SHA1.
  This means that it will only work on IA-32 and x86-64 platforms.

These problems will probably go away once I add a proper configure script.

CommonCrypto has been released by Apple under a APSL/BSD license. The port is
maintained by Niels Grewe <niels.grewe@halbordnung.de>. Please direct all
criticisms, suggestions or bug reports to him.
